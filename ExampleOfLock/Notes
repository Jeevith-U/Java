# Synchronization will impact on the performance of the application because it will execute the methods one by one

Advantages of Locks over Synchronization
- Fine-Grained Control: Locks provide explicit methods to lock and unlock, giving finer control over the critical section.
- Non-Blocking Try-Lock: The ability to try acquiring a lock without blocking improves performance and flexibility.
- Timeouts: Locks can specify timeouts for acquiring a lock, preventing indefinite blocking.
- Interruptibility: Locks can be acquired interruptibly, allowing for better thread management.
- Fairness: Locks can be configured for fairness, ensuring a more predictable order of thread execution.
- Read/Write Locks: The distinction between read and write locks allows for more efficient concurrency management.
